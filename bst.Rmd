First, we load the dataset and get every package we need ready.
```{r}
df = read.csv('rehosp.csv')
test = read.csv("test_rehosp.csv")

library(gbm)
```

Then we the gbm function to build a boosting method model. We name it "bm".
```{r}
bm = gbm(hospital~., data = df, distribution = 'adaboost', 
         n.trees = 500, interaction.depth = 2, shrinkage = 0.01, verbose = F)
```

Now let's see how well it performed.
```{r}
pdtn =predict(bm,newdata = test, n.trees = 500)
sqrt(mean((pdtn-test$hospital)^2))
```
